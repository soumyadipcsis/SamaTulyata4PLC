# SamaTulyata4PLC
The tool is written in python
Its is a verifier for PLC programs. It is also open source.
For our experiemntation, we translate TCL code to Petri net and SFC to Petri net 
Now the current version of SamaTulyata4PLC works on those generated Petri net 
TCL to SFC Migration is carried out propitory tool.
SamaTulyata4PLC integrated with the propitory tool. So the verification time includes the tool initial set up time.
In each benchmark, the initial setup of the tool is performed.
In the benchmark file is  contains all tcl files for experimentation.
All bechmarks are opensource benchmarks. 
Tool demo is also available for a small bechmarks.
The tool output for a smaple program gives exhaustive results for the --detail flag option.
Overall verification time including tool initialization takes 10-20 sec for large benchmarks. 

# Ecclipse plugin
 First version of PN based equivalence checker Ecclipse plugin version is also uploaded for further comparison if possible. 
 However, it works on C language.(Published at ATVA 2017)
